# .NetBuildTools
Some basic build scripts for use with my .NET C# projects. Main goal of this project is to provide some automation for building local (and, maybe, customized) nuget packages and dll's of common dependencies that I use in my projects.

Currently supported platforms - msbuild (windows, WORK IN PROGRESS), and xbuild (linux only, for now).
